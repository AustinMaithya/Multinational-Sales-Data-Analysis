MULTINATIONAL SALES ANALYSIS 
INTRODUCTION 
The following  project contains sales data from various countries which are Canada, China,  India,  Nigeria, UK and USA. The data was stored in different excel sheets in the csv formats.
Tools Used ; 
1.	MySQL – This was used for data pre-processing and analysis. I used it to join the data using the UNION ALL function since the tables had the same number of columns  ,I also used it to check for duplicates and nulls  and on the analysis side of it I used it to answer several business questions as follows :
SALES PERFORMANCE QUESTIONS 
I.	Which country is generating the highest sales revenue?
II.	 What is the average order value by country or product?
III.	Which products or categories are selling best by region?
IV.	Which markets are underperforming?
V.	Profit by category
VI.	Profit by country


2.	Microsoft Excel -  I used this to create pivot tables and create a simple dashboard indicating certain metrics such as ;
I.	Total Revenue
II.	Quantity Sold
III.	Sales Trend by Month
IV.	Method of Transaction distribution by purchases
V.	Sales Distribution by age and year
VI.	Quantity of goods  purchased by city
VII.	Revenue Distribution by gender and category 

3.	ODBC  Connector – This was to Connect Data from MySQL to Excel to create dashboard 


FINDINGS
